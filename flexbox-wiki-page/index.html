          From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia For other uses, see Giraffe
          (disambiguation). The giraffe is a large African hoofed mammal
          belonging to the genus Giraffa. It is the tallest living terrestrial
          animal and the largest ruminant on Earth. Traditionally, giraffes have
          been thought of as one species, Giraffa camelopardalis, with nine
          subspecies. Most recently, researchers proposed dividing them into
          four extant species due to new research into their mitochondrial and
          nuclear DNA, and individual species can be distinguished by their fur
          coat patterns. Seven other extinct species of Giraffa are known from
          the fossil record. The giraffe's distinguishing characteristics are
          its extremely long neck and legs, horn-like ossicones, and spotted
          coat patterns. It is classified under the family Giraffidae, along
          with its closest extant relative, the okapi. Its scattered range
          extends from Chad in the north to South Africa in the south and from
          Niger in the west to Somalia in the east. Giraffes usually inhabit
          savannahs and woodlands. Their food source is leaves, fruits, and
          flowers of woody plants, primarily acacia species, which they browse
          at heights most other ground-based herbivores cannot reach. Lions,
          leopards, spotted hyenas, and African wild dogs may prey upon
          giraffes. Giraffes live in herds of related females and their
          offspring or bachelor herds of unrelated adult males but are
          gregarious and may gather in large groups. Males establish social
          hierarchies through "necking", combat bouts where the neck is used as
          a weapon. Dominant males gain mating access to females, which bear
          sole responsibility for rearing the young. The giraffe has intrigued
          various ancient and modern cultures for its peculiar appearance and
          has often been featured in paintings, books, and cartoons. It is
          classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature
          (IUCN) as vulnerable to extinction. It has been extirpated from many
          parts of its former range. Giraffes are still found in many national
          parks and game reserves, but estimates as of 2016 indicate there are
          approximately 97,500 members of Giraffa in the wild. More than 1,600
          were kept in zoos in 2010.
